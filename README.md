## Project Story

HealthIQ was inspired by my own life. I was born in Guinea and moved to New York when I was six. I didn‚Äôt speak English and had to learn quickly. I struggled in school and especially with understanding medical documents and paperwork. My parents had it even harder, and I remember seeing how confusing it all was.

Over time I learned the language, got into tech, and wanted to build something that could help people like us. HealthIQ is a tool that lets you scan any medical paper, prescription, or food label, and it tells you what it actually means. Simple and clear. It gives tips, warnings, ingredient details, and more ‚Äî powered by AI and OCR.

This project is personal to me. It‚Äôs something I wish existed for my family when we first came here.

üèÜ Inspirational Story Prize Submission
HealthIQ comes from a real place. Being an immigrant, struggling with language, and watching my family feel lost when reading medical documents motivated me to build this app. I wanted to help people understand their health better using the tools we now have ‚Äî AI, OCR, and modern web tech.
